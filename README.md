# Simpl‑Fy

Simpl‑Fy is a modern, mobile‑responsive landing page template aimed at IT‑services and product showcase sites. It is built with **React** and **Vite**, providing a fast development experience and a clean, extensible codebase. The template includes a sleek navigation header that adapts to all devices, complete with a fullscreen mobile menu, and lays the groundwork for sections such as **Features**, **About**, **Services**, and **Contact**.

## About The Project

**Simpl‑Fy** is designed as a starting point for building stylish, responsive landing pages. Out of the box it delivers a responsive header with a hamburger menu that slides open on mobile, locking the page scroll to focus the user’s attention. The layout is modular and easy to extend—simply drop in your own components for the main sections and customise the styling to suit your brand.

## Built With

* [React](https://react.dev/) – JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) – Blazing‑fast development tooling for modern web projects
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) – Client‑side routing for single‑page applications

## Features

* **Mobile‑first design** – A responsive header with a hamburger menu that animates to a fullscreen navigation overlay
* **Dynamic navigation** – Toggle the mobile menu state with React hooks and manage scroll locking for a polished UX
* **Clean CSS modules** – Component‑scoped styles keep the layout easy to maintain and customise
* **Extensible layout** – Predefined placeholders for About, Services and Contact sections make it easy to add content

## Roadmap

The initial roadmap items—implementing the About/Services/Contact sections, adding forms with validation, adding animations, and writing unit/integration tests—have been completed. Going forward, consider these enhancements:

* **Theme toggle** – Provide light/dark mode options to improve accessibility and user preference.
* **Internationalisation (i18n)** – Support multiple languages to reach a broader audience.
* **Analytics integration** – Add a tool such as Google Analytics or Plausible to understand how visitors use the site.
* **Search engine optimisation (SEO)** – Improve discoverability with meta tags, social preview images, and structured data.
* **Testimonials or case studies** – Showcase customer success stories to build trust.
* **Progressive Web App (PWA) features** – Enable offline support and “Add to Home Screen” on mobile devices.
